"""
Comcast "Everything App" Architecture Example for AG UI + LangGraph

This example demonstrates:
1. Supervisor agent routing to domain-specific subagents
2. Dynamic client tool filtering via middleware (VERSION-AGNOSTIC!)
3. AG UI pattern: Agent tool calls â†’ Frontend UI components
4. HITL interrupts for user confirmations

Architecture:
- Supervisor routes customer requests to WiFi or Video domain specialists
- Each domain subagent has MCP tools + dynamically injected client tools
- Client advertises available tools â†’ Middleware filters by domain â†’ Tools injected
- Client tools (confirmation_dialog, etc.) trigger UI components in frontend
- Interrupts pause execution until user provides input via UI

Key Innovation: CLIENT TOOL ADVERTISEMENT
- Frontend sends list of available UI tools in config
- Backend is version-agnostic - works with whatever client supports
- Middleware filters client tools by domain relevance
- Old app versions (fewer tools) and new versions (more tools) both work
