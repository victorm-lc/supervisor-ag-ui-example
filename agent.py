"""
Example "Everything App" Architecture Example for AG UI + LangGraph + MCP

This example demonstrates:
1. Supervisor agent routing to domain-specific subagents
2. Dynamic client tool filtering via middleware (VERSION-AGNOSTIC!)
3. **MCP integration: Each domain has its own MCP server** (WiFi Gateway, Video Gateway)
4. AG UI pattern: Agent tool calls ‚Üí Frontend UI components
5. HITL interrupts for user confirmations

Architecture:
- Supervisor routes customer requests to WiFi or Video domain specialists
- Each domain subagent has **MCP server tools** + dynamically injected client tools
- **MCP servers** provide domain-specific backend tools (wifi_diagnostic, search_content)
- Client advertises available tools ‚Üí Middleware filters by domain ‚Üí Tools injected
- Client tools (confirmation_dialog, play_video) trigger UI components in frontend
- Interrupts pause execution until user provides input via UI

Key Innovation 1: CLIENT TOOL ADVERTISEMENT
- Frontend sends list of available UI tools in config
- Backend is version-agnostic - works with whatever client supports
- Middleware filters client tools by domain relevance
- Old app versions (fewer tools) and new versions (more tools) both work

Key Innovation 2: MCP INTEGRATION (Example PATTERN!)
- Each domain has dedicated MCP server (just like their architecture!)
- WiFi Gateway MCP: wifi_diagnostic, restart_router
- Video Gateway MCP: search_content
- Clean separation: MCP tools (backend) + Client tools (frontend UI)

# AG UI CLIENT TOOLS - Now in tool_registry.py!
# =============================================================================
# Client tools (confirmation_dialog, error_display, play_video, etc.) are defined in
# tool_registry.py and dynamically injected by the middleware below.
# This allows the backend to be version-agnostic - it works with whatever
# tools the client advertises, regardless of app version.
#
# ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY:
# - MCP tools (wifi_diagnostic, restart_router, search_content) ‚Üí Backend services
# - Client tools (confirmation_dialog, play_video) ‚Üí Frontend UI components


# =============================================================================
# DOMAIN TOOL FILTERING MIDDLEWARE (Example PATTERN)
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ THE KEY INNOVATION: Version-Agnostic Backend
#
# This architecture solves the problem of having multiple client versions in production:
# - Mobile v1.0 may only support ['confirmation_dialog', 'error_display']
# - Mobile v2.0 adds ['network_status_display', 'play_video']
# - Web v1.0 may have all tools from day 1
#
# The backend stays AGNOSTIC to versions:
# 1. Client advertises what it supports: config.configurable.advertised_client_tools
# 2. Middleware filters by domain: WiFi agent gets network_status_display, Video agent gets play_video
# 3. Backend never needs updating when client adds new tools!
#
# This mapping defines which client tools are RELEVANT for each domain.
# The client advertises what it HAS, this mapping defines what each domain NEEDS.

DOMAIN_TOOL_MAPPING = {
    "wifi": ["confirmation_dialog", "error_display", "network_status_display"],
    "video": ["confirmation_dialog", "error_display", "play_video"],  # play_video with return_direct!
}


class DomainToolFilterMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    """
    Middleware that dynamically filters and injects client tools based on domain.
    
    HOW IT WORKS:
    1. Frontend sends list of tool names in config: advertised_client_tools
    2. Middleware intercepts each model call via wrap_model_call
    3. Reads advertised tools from request.runtime.config.configurable
    4. Filters to domain-relevant tools using DOMAIN_TOOL_MAPPING
    5. Looks up tool implementations from CLIENT_TOOL_REGISTRY
    6. Sets request.tools to the filtered list before calling the model
    
    This makes the backend VERSION-AGNOSTIC:
    - Old app (v1.0): ["confirmation_dialog", "error_display"] ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
    - New app (v2.0): ["confirmation_dialog", "error_display", "network_status_display", "play_video"] ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
